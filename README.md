# Symbol Table with Binary Search Tree

In this project a symbol table is implemented in the form of a binary search tree and used to record suspects. Firstly there are 2 basic classes `Suspect` and `TreeNode` which they refer to the suspects and the nodes of the tree respectivly. For each suspect an import is being made to the tree with key being his AFM. Specifically the nodes in the tree are of type Suspect.
